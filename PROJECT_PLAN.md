# PROJECT_PLAN.md — FEM Electromagnetics Solver for MRI Coil Simulation

**Single source of truth for scope, status, and sequencing.** Resolved defects and
the reasoning behind past decisions live in [`docs/project-history.md`](docs/project-history.md);
nothing there is a task.

---

## 1. Mission

A FEniCSX/DolfinX finite element solver for electromagnetic simulation of MRI coils
loaded with gelled saline phantoms. Target capability:

1. Generate realistic birdcage coil + phantom geometry
2. Solve magnetostatic and **time-harmonic** Maxwell problems with complex,
   frequency-dependent materials
3. Produce credible field diagnostics and ParaView-friendly outputs
4. Produce lumped-port S-parameters usable for downstream tuning workflows

Commercial solvers (HFSS, CST) are expensive and black-box; open-source
alternatives (Elmer, OpenEMS) lack MRI-specific features. This is the gap.

---

## 2. Current state — read before planning work

A **validated magnetostatics core**, and a large body of scaffolding whose green
tests do not mean what they appear to mean.

### 2.1 The time-harmonic solver — proxy replaced 2026-07-31, closed form matched

**Was:** `core/time_harmonic.py` ran the *magnetostatic* solver for `A`, then set
`E_real ≡ 0`, `E_imag = −ω·A`. No `ω²εE` term, no `jωσ` term, no complex system;
the material response `σ + jωε₀εᵣ` was computed and discarded, so phantom
conductivity and permittivity had zero effect on any computed field.

**Now:** `TH-1` steps 1–3 landed — a complex N1curl curl-curl solve of
`∇×(μᵣ⁻¹∇×E) − k₀²ε_c E = −jωμ₀J` with MUMPS, gated by a manufactured solution
that converges at the discretisation rate (`0.9929` measured in `h`, N1curl
degree 1) and by the complex-symmetric-but-not-Hermitian structure of the
assembled operator. `ε_c` now enters the matrix, and the run requires the
complex DolfinX build (real mode raises rather than silently dropping the loss
term).

**Step 4 landed 2026-07-31** (`tests/validation/test_lossy_plane_wave.py`): the
solve now reproduces a *physical* closed form. Driving a box with the analytic
lossy plane wave `E = ẑe^{−jkx}`, `k = k₀√(ε_c)`, on its boundary and measuring
the **interior** decay and phase gives `α = 13.0695` vs `13.0670 Np/m` (**0.019%**)
and `β = 27.0312` vs `27.0152 rad/m` (**0.059%**), with the field itself at
**3.61%** relative L2 and a measured `O(h)` rate of `0.9998`. `MAT-2` rides on
the same gate: σ = 0.1 → 1.4 S/m moves the decay constant by **10.32×**, against
a closed-form **10.3116×** (0.113%), each α matching its own closed form to
< 0.24%. Conductivity now demonstrably drives the solved field.

**Step 5 landed the same day:** `core/resonance.py` flags near-resonant sweep
points from stored-energy continuity (`S = |dlnW/dlnf| ≈ 2f/|f−f₀|`, threshold
50 ⇒ 4% detuning), verified firing at 1.5% from the `TH-9` fundamental with the
energy rise matching the `|f−f₀|⁻²` pole law to 3.16%. **`TH-1` is closed.**

**What this does and does not license.** The frequency-domain *formulation* is
now validated against a physical closed form in a homogeneous medium, **and, as
of 2026-07-31, against a loaded coil**: `MAT-6` closed with the FEM coil
resistance change over a conductive half-space matching Dodd–Deeds to **1.58%**
(§7). The loading claim is real but bounded — it is established in the *eddy-
current* regime (10 MHz, σ = 100 S/m, loss tangent 1.8e5), and the reactive part
ΔX is gated only on sign and magnitude, so "the phantom loads the coil at
127.74 MHz" (loss tangent ≈ 1.26, displacement current not negligible) is an
extrapolation, not a validated result: it needs the full-wave kernel named in
the `MAT-6` step-2 entry. §2.2's heuristic S-parameters are untouched by any of
this — `PORT-1` still owns that.

### 2.2 The S-parameters are heuristic, not computed

`ports/excitation.py` discards the solved field and derives port voltages from
invented constants (`1e-3 * support` is dimensionally meaningless; a `0.20`
coupling factor is arbitrary). The orientation-flip test passes because a helper
returns `−1.0` when two orientation *strings* differ. `PORT-1` is the fix.

*(2026-08-02, `PORT-1` step 2: there is now **one** S-matrix in the repo that is
not heuristic — `tests/validation/test_port_reaction_impedance.py` converts a
reaction Z-matrix from a solved two-loop field through
`S = (Z − Z₀I)(Z + Z₀I)⁻¹` and gates it symmetric, passive and unitary. It is a
two-loop air fixture, not a coil, and `ports/excitation.py` is untouched: every
S-parameter the **package** produces is still heuristic.)*

*(2026-08-03, `PORT-1` step 3a: the **conversion** now lives in `src/` —
`ports.sparameters_from_impedance()`, pure numpy, gated bit-identical to the test
path on that solved field, with `PORT-5`'s sanity metrics reporting
`passivity_max_sigma = 1.000000000000` on a real matrix for the first time. This
does not move the sentence above: `run_n_port_sparameter_sweep` still gets its
port voltages from `excitation.py`, so **every S-parameter the package produces
end to end is still heuristic**. What changed is that a caller holding an honest
Z now has an honest conversion to call.)*

### 2.3 Test assertions cannot detect either problem

Finiteness checks (`np.isfinite`, `> 0`) dominate the solver, port, material, and
post-processing suites. A solver returning `E = −ωA` passed every time-harmonic,
port, and workflow test in the repo — every one of those tests still passes
against the real complex solve, which is the measure of how little they assert.
The quantitative gates are `tests/validation/test_time_harmonic_mms.py` and
`tests/validation/test_lossy_plane_wave.py` (`TH-6` + `MAT-2`).

### 2.3b Phase-1 analytic validation was also broken (repaired 2026-07-27/30)

Nearly every Phase-1 test evaluated fields with `B.eval(points, np.arange(n))`,
which evaluates each point in an arbitrary cell. Those tests are now repaired
(`MAG-7`…`MAG-9`, `MAG-13`, `MAG-14`) and the claim "validated against analytic
solutions" is now supported for magnetostatics — but only there. See
`docs/project-history.md` for the audit that found it.

### 2.4 What is genuinely trustworthy

- **The magnetostatic formulation in `core/solvers.py`.** N1curl weak form
  `∫μ⁻¹(∇×A)·(∇×v) dx` with gauge penalty, matching closed-form Helmholtz to
  **0.04% at centre / 0.83% mean**, monotone convergence in domain size and `h`.
- The repaired validation suite: `test_helmholtz_magnitude.py` (0.728% vs closed
  form since the `GEO-8` fragment fix, 2026-08-01; 1.731% before),
  `test_circular_loop.py` (7.07%), `test_convergence.py` (fitted rate 1.10),
  `test_cavity_resonances.py` (0.0436%), `test_gauge_lagrange.py`.
- `post/evaluation.py` — correct bounding-box/collision point location. All point
  evaluation must go through it.
- Gmsh geometry generation, mesh-tag QA, and `scripts/testing/run_and_log.sh`.

### 2.5 Before you debug a failing test

**Check [`docs/testing/known-issues.md`](docs/testing/known-issues.md) first.** It
lists every currently-failing test with symptom, the commit it was verified failing
at, and the diagnosed cause. Several tests fail on `main` for reasons unrelated to
any change you are making.

## 3. Status legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ VERIFIED | Test executed, assertion is quantitative, passing |
| 🟡 IN PROGRESS | Actively being implemented |
| 🧪 UNVERIFIED | Code landed; test has never actually executed anywhere |
| ⚠️ PLACEHOLDER-BACKED | Implemented and "green", but rests on §2.1/§2.2 proxies |
| ⬜ NOT STARTED | |
| 🚫 BLOCKED | Cannot proceed; blocker named in the chunk |

`⚠️` is not a bug report against the chunk's own code — it means the chunk cannot
be trusted until `TH-1` lands. Do not "fix" a `⚠️` chunk by loosening its test.

**A measurement-only step is `🧪`, never `✅`** *(clarified 2026-08-02, 18:00
review, after an audit found two probe steps carrying `✅`)*. Several chunks are
split into a probe step whose stated product is "measurements, assert nothing"
and a gate step that turns those measurements into bounds. The probe step lands
real code and real logs, but §4.3 asks for an executed quantitative *assertion*,
and a script that only prints has none — so the probe step is `🧪` until its
gate lands, however good its numbers are. This is a clarification of §4, not an
exception to it: the fix is to write the gate, never to widen §4. Demoted on
this ground 2026-08-02: `PORT-1` step 1, `MAT-6` step 2a. (`PORT-1` step 1 was
restored to ✅ the same day when its gate, step 2, landed — which is exactly
the intended route back.)

---

## 4. Definition of done

A chunk is `✅ VERIFIED` when **all** of the following hold:

1. **Code and docs are committed.**
2. **The agent executed the verification command itself** and recorded the result
   via `scripts/testing/run_and_log.sh`. A chunk does not park on a human.
3. **The assertion is quantitative** — at least one check compares against:
   - a closed-form analytic solution, with a stated tolerance
   - a measured convergence rate under h- or p-refinement
   - a conservation, reciprocity, or symmetry identity
   - a documented reference value from literature or a prior validated run

   > **Finiteness-only gate:** a chunk may **not** be `✅` if every assertion it
   > adds is "is finite", "is non-zero", "has shape N", or "did not raise". Those
   > are welcome as *additional* assertions and insufficient as the *only* ones.
4. **Its runtime tier is declared and its measured elapsed time recorded.**
5. **Any dependency on a `⚠️` chunk is stated explicitly** in the chunk entry.

Never loosen a failing assertion to make a test pass. A failing analytic
comparison is evidence about the test as much as about the code.

### When human verification *is* required

Reserve it for judgments a test cannot make, and name the judgment: "does this B1+
map look physically plausible in ParaView?", "is this refinement acceptable near
the port faces?", "does this S11 curve resemble published birdcage behavior?"
Never for routine pass/fail.

---

## 5. Execution policy

### 5.1 Compute budget — shared machine

The development server is a **shared 36-core box; this project may use at most 12
cores.** Every verification command declares a tier and must not exceed it:

| Tier | Ceiling | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | 30 s | Imports, pure-Python logic, config validation |
| `standard` | 3 min | Coarse meshes, single small solves — the default |
| `heavy` | 20 min | Convergence studies, sweeps — must be labeled `heavy` |

- Wrap commands in `timeout` at the tier ceiling. **If a run overruns, kill it and
  redesign the case smaller.** Never re-run with a longer timeout. 20 minutes is a
  hard ceiling for any single compute command regardless of tier.
- **`mpiexec -n 12` is the hard rank ceiling.** Use the smallest count that fits
  the tier — more ranks on a fixed mesh stop paying quickly, and a bigger mesh is
  usually a better use of the budget than more ranks on a small one. Keep `-n 2`
  for anything a rank-local bug could hide in (`MAG-11` was a missing allreduce
  visible only under MPI), and note that CI runs at `-n 2`, so a test that only
  passes at wider ranks is not CI-portable.
- Record real elapsed time in `docs/testing/test-results.md`.
- **A tier is a measurement, not an intention.** A chunk whose runtime has never
  been measured is `unmeasured`. Cost-probe first: build the mesh, print the cell
  count, solve a tiny case, extrapolate, then size the real case to fit.

Cost is dominated by mesh size: ~8×10³ cells solve in seconds, ~4×10⁵ cells take
minutes, and CI cannot host the `heavy` tier.

### 5.2 Agent autonomy and loop hygiene

- Agents implement **and verify**. Human-gated completion is prohibited (§4.2).
- **No-op guard:** if a work cycle produces only documentation edits and executes
  no verification command, stop and escalate rather than commit an audit note.
- **Do not append duplicate status blocks.** Status lives in §7 tables;
  `docs/testing/pending-tests.md` is an append-only *log*, not a status store.

### 5.3 Verification environment — Docker

All verification runs inside the `fem-em-solver` container. Preflight
`docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps` — STATUS must be "Up"; `exec`
fails with `service ... is not running` otherwise, and that is a *setup* error,
not a test failure. Do **not** use the `cd docker && ...` form: a `cd` inside a
compound command prompts for permission regardless of the allowlist, which fails
in scheduled sessions.

One-time setup: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build` (~4 min), then
`... up -d`. The repo mounts at `/workspace`, so source edits need no rebuild.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Image / base | `fem-em-solver:latest` (6.26 GB) on `dolfinx/dolfinx:v0.7.2` |
| dolfinx / Python | 0.7.2 / 3.10.12 |
| Default PETSc scalar | `numpy.float64` — **real mode** |
| Complex build | `/usr/local/dolfinx-complex` |
| Memory cap | 16 GB |

**Complex scalars**, required by `TH-1`:
`source /usr/local/bin/dolfinx-complex-mode` (→ `numpy.complex128`);
`dolfinx-real-mode` switches back. The chunk commands set
`PYTHONPATH=/workspace/src`, which drops the container's dolfinx path;
`src/sitecustomize.py` re-appends the dist-packages directory matching the active
`PETSC_ARCH`, so imports resolve in **either** mode. Set
`FEM_EM_REQUIRE_COMPLEX=1` on any run that is supposed to be complex, so the
real-mode skips in `tests/environment/test_complex_mode.py` become failures, and
put `tests/environment` first in the pytest path list.

Run everything through the harness so results land in
`docs/testing/test-results.md` and `docs/testing/logs/`:

```bash
scripts/testing/run_and_log.sh <CHUNK-ID> "docker compose exec -T fem-em-solver bash -lc '...'"
```

Use `exec -T` — without it `exec` allocates a TTY and can hang under an agent. The
harness exports `COMPOSE_FILE` itself; a bare `docker compose` outside `docker/`
needs `-f docker/docker-compose.yml`.

## 6. Phase map

| Phase | Goal | Gating chunks | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Infrastructure, packaging, CI, meshing | `OPS-1`, `OPS-2` | Done |
| 1 | Magnetostatics + analytic validation | `MAG-1`…`MAG-6` | **Complete and trustworthy** |
| 2 | Time-harmonic Maxwell, complex materials, ABC/PML | `TH-1`…`TH-9` | In progress — every analytic gate closed (`TH-1`/`TH-6`/`TH-7`/`TH-8`/`TH-9` ✅); `TH-2`/`TH-3` API hardening ⚠️ |
| 3 | Material models, phantoms, SAR | `MAT-1`…`MAT-6` | `MAT-2` ✅; `MAT-6` ✅ (ΔR to 1.58%, eddy-current regime); SAR still ungated |
| 4 | Coil modeling, lumped elements, ports, S-params | `PORT-1`…`PORT-8` | Placeholder-backed |
| 5 | Full MRI system: loaded birdcage, B1+, SAR maps | `WF-5`…`WF-8` | Blocked on Phases 2–4 |
| 6 | Advanced: MPI scaling, AMR, sweeps, optimization | — | Deferred |

### Critical path

```
TH-1 (real complex time-harmonic formulation)
   ├─> TH-6/7/8 (analytic validation gates)
   ├─> MAT-2 ──> MAT-6 (materials actually affect fields; Dodd–Deeds)
   └─> PORT-1 (real port excitation) ──> PORT-2…8 ──> WF-5…8
```

**`TH-1` landed 2026-07-31; the constraint moves one link down the chain.** The
`⚠️` backlog still may not be extended until revalidated against the real solve,
and nothing S-parameter-shaped should grow until `PORT-1` replaces the heuristic.
Adding features to a proxy is what produced the `⚠️` backlog in the first place.

## 7. Chunk backlog

IDs are prefixed by subsystem and **globally unique and stable**. Legacy
`A1`/`B2`/`C3` IDs in commit messages and `pending-tests.md` map here via §8.
These tables are the authoritative *status*; per-chunk historical detail is in
`docs/testing/pending-tests.md`.

**`OPS-10` — complex-mode CI job.** `TH-1` steps 1–5 put every frequency-domain
test behind `@complex_only`, and the `validation` job runs real mode, so between
steps 1–3 and this chunk CI executed **no** time-harmonic solve at all — the MMS
convergence gate, the lossy plane-wave closed form (`TH-6`), the conductivity
gate (`MAT-2`) and the resonance guard all skipped silently. The
`validation-complex` job sources `/usr/local/bin/dolfinx-complex-mode` and runs
`tests/environment` (first, so an environment regression is not blamed on the
formulation) plus `test_time_harmonic_mms.py`, `test_lossy_plane_wave.py`,
`test_resonance_guard.py`, `test_time_harmonic_smoke.py` and
`test_boundary_condition_selection.py` under `FEM_EM_REQUIRE_COMPLEX=1`, which
converts the skips into failures so the job cannot pass by skipping. Verified
2026-07-31: 18 passed in 32 s at `-n 2` with the CI-fidelity invocation (no
`PYTHONPATH` override, package from `pip install -e`), and the real-mode
negative control fails 3 of 4 environment tests with "the complex build was not
picked up" rather than skipping. Three `@complex_only` tests are still outside
any job; the CI file names them at the point they should be added. *(2026-07-31
review: the claim that all three are blocked on known-issues entries 1 and 2 is
half stale — entry 1's two tests actually **passed** under the complex build in
`20260731T003802Z_TH-1-steps123-complexsuite.log`, because `TH-1` deleted the
code path they were failing in. Retiring entry 1 and adding those files to the
job is a §9 On-deck item. Entry 2 remains genuinely open.)*

**Open follow-ups in MAG** (none currently on deck):

- `MAG-6`'s revised test has never been executed. Its predecessor failed at
  `max relative |B| mismatch = 0.322` against a `< 0.30` limit — treat that figure
  as unreliable, it came from the `MAG-7` broken evaluation path.
- `MAG-13` did not reach the < 5% target on the wire. Extrapolating the measured
  rate puts it at h ≈ 0.00125, ~1.1M cells, > 5 min at `-n 2` — which was outside
  the budget when `heavy` was 10 min at 2 ranks, and **is now plausibly inside it**
  at 20 min and up to 12 ranks. Cost-probe before assuming so. The residual is
  uniform-mesh discretization of a 1/r field next to a thin conductor, so graded
  refinement is still the cheaper route than more uniform h.
  `J·n ≠ 0` at the end caps also still stands; capping the wire short of the end
  faces was never needed and is unmeasured.
- `MAG-15` is a working option, not a finished subsystem: Dirichlet conditions on
  `A` are rejected (`bc_functions` raises — so `TimeHarmonicBoundaryCondition.PEC`
  would not work); the point-pin on `p` is not `H¹`-stable in 3D, so use
  `gauge_multiplier_spread()` rather than `max|p|`; it is not wired through
  `TimeHarmonicSolver` or the port entry points; and the degree-2 cost (~7.5×
  the penalty) is unprofiled against MUMPS.

> **Formulation notes:**
> - **The sign convention is part of the spec.** The equation assumes `e^{+jωt}`,

> - **Do not port the gauge penalty.** At ω > 0 the operator acts as `−k₀²ε_c` on
>   the gradient subspace — nonzero everywhere, dissipative wherever σ > 0. The
>   `MAG-10` disease is statics-only; a penalty here would *add* error.
> - **Phase 2's silent-failure mode is near-resonance ill-conditioning.** With PEC
>   boundaries and lossless air the matrix is exactly singular at cavity
>   eigenfrequencies — and an MRI coil is deliberately operated near resonance.

>    against the `TH-9` fixture, driven at its **discrete** fundamental (taken
>    from the `TH-9` eigen-solver on the same mesh, not from the closed form):

>    (implied detuning 1.454%, against the ~1.5% the sweep was placed at), while

## 9. Immediate sequencing

Phase 1 is complete and CI guards it. `TH-1` closed 2026-07-31 against the lossy
plane-wave closed form; attention moves to the loaded-coil gate and ports.

1. ~~**`MAT-6` step 2**~~ — **done 2026-07-31** (steps 2a + 2b): ΔR matches
   Dodd–Deeds to 1.58%, so coil loading is licensed *in the eddy-current
   regime*. The saline/Larmor case needs the full-wave kernel; SAR (`MAT-4`)
   is still ungated.
2. ~~**`TH-7`**~~ — **done 2026-07-31** (γ to 0.006%); ~~**`TH-8`**~~ —
   **done 2026-07-31** (interior `E` matches `3/(εᵣ+2)E₀` to 2.44%). The cheap
   closed-form gates on the frequency-domain solver are exhausted; `MAT-4`
   step 1 continued that sphere fixture onto the *imaginary* axis of `ε_c`
   on 2026-08-03 (mean SAR within 3.5%).
3. **`POST-3`** — 🟡: steps 1–2 landed 2026-07-31 (Poynting real-power balance,
   4.13% on the `TH-6` fixture with a σ-blind control at 95.2%; then σ(x) as a
   DG0 field, 4.49% on a two-slab σ = 0.1 | 1.4 S/m solve, control at 99.2%);
   step 3 landed 2026-08-02 (total-current divergence residual, 9.32e-2 → 6.36e-2
   at rate 0.942 in h, with a CG1-vs-CG2 vacuity control separating by 1.5e13).
   What remains is piecewise μᵣ and reciprocity.
4. **`PORT-1`** — 🟡, and the most active chunk in the plan. `GEO-8` unblocked
   the fixture 2026-08-01; **steps 1 and 2 are ✅** (2026-08-02: reciprocity
   2.65e-13, `Im Z₁₂` within 9.35% of the closed-form `ωM₁₂`, `Re Z₁₂`
   structurally zero, and the repo's **first S-matrix derived from a solved
   field** — symmetric to 2.6e-13 and unitary to 1.000000000000). **Step 2b is
   ✅ as a diagnosis** (2026-08-03): the reaction integral is exonerated — two
   independent routes to `Im Z₁₁` agree to 1.8e-10 — and the negative diagonal
   is localised to an **electric-energy excess**, `W_e/W_m = 6.524`, so no
   `Z_in` and no `S₁₁` may be read off this fixture's diagonal. **Step 2c is ✅
   2026-08-03** — the coupling falls off like `M(2d)/M(d)` to −5.93% against a
   10% bound, so `Z₁₂` is now gated as a *geometric* quantity, not one
   magnitude. **Step 3a is ✅ 2026-08-03** — `sparameters_from_impedance()` is
   in `ports/sparameters.py` and `PORT-5`'s sanity metrics have now scored a
   real matrix. Two spurs remain, independent: **2d** charging that `W_e`
   excess to the load vector, and **3b** gap-voltage birdcage ports — 3b alone
   needs `GEO-9` step 2b.
5. **`GEO-9`** — 🟡: created 2026-08-02 from known-issues 7, **step 1 ✅
   2026-08-03**, and step 1 refuted the hypothesis it was written on.
   `coil_phantom_domain` generates fine in a fresh process; the whole of
   known-issues 7 is the **birdcage** raising without reaching
   `gmsh.finalize()` and poisoning every later mesh in the process — which also
   *hangs* it (harness exit 124 at the ceiling). **Step 2a ✅ 2026-08-03**: the
   hang was two defects, gmsh contamination *and* an MPI collective mismatch,
   both fixed — 180 s hang → 13 s prompt failure, isolation gate exit 0.
   **Step 2b ✅ 2026-08-03, and the chunk is closed**: one `occ.fragment`
   against all tools with the groups re-derived from the out-map; both volume
   identities 1.000000000000 at `1e-9`, all four port boxes exact, whole
   `tests/mesh` green in CI at 42.15 s. Known-issues 7 retires with it. Two of
   the four §10 Target criteria route through these fixtures — **both birdcage
   fixtures now generate**, so `PORT-1` step 3b (gap-voltage ports) is
   unblocked and needs a review to firm up its plan against the measured mesh.
6. **Air-box generalization** — every other `io/mesh.py` fixture still uses a
   single global `setSize` and tight padding, including coil+phantom. Distinct
   from `GEO-9`, which is about whether the mesh exists at all.
7. Then `PORT-4`…`PORT-8`, then Phase 5 (`WF-5`…`WF-8`).

**Do not add new features to `⚠️` subsystems.** Extending a proxy is what produced
the current backlog: roughly 20 chunks of scaffolding needing revalidation.

**Do not trust a chunk's status without a log.** Two independent classes of defect
survived months of dashboard maintenance because nothing ever executed. Every
status in §7 that is not `✅` should be read as "unknown", not "probably fine".

### On deck — maintained by the scheduled daily review

The next scheduled implementer run takes the **first** item below that is not
marked done or blocked (see `docs/automation/implementer-run.md`). At least five
open items — the four runs before the next review, plus a spare — ordered, each
sized for one run: ≤ 1 h wall clock, ≤ 20 min per compute command. Prefer items
that do not depend on each other; where the critical path is genuinely serial,
say so in the item. Items that fail twice get rescoped by the review before they
may reappear. If every item is done, the implementer falls back to the "obvious
next entry" named below.

Last reviewed 2026-08-04, 03:00 daily review. Tree clean at review end; no
`attempt/*` branches. One `recovered/*` branch found and disposed:
`recovered/20260804T020013Z` held only the two untracked
`circular_loop_results.txt` files (generated example-02 output, journaled at
00:30Z, parked at 02:00Z per the second-encounter rule) — content fully
captured in attempts.md, branch **deleted**, and the recurring cause ended by
ignoring `circular_loop_results.txt` in `.gitignore`, the one-line disposition
both journal entries requested. The dirty-tree source is named and closed, not
just cleared: any interactive run of example 02 was arming the next slot's
preflight, and it cost the queue exactly one slot (19:30 CDT) before the
protocol's park-and-proceed path contained it.

**4/4 slots fired — 3 completions, 1 designed preflight stop.** 19:30 CDT
stopped clean on the untracked example output (first encounter, correct per
implementer-run.md step 1); 21:00 landed `MAT-4` step 2; 22:30 landed `POST-3`
step 4; 00:00 landed `PORT-1` step 2e. Eleven harness logs, all registered in
test-results.md. The 2026-08-03 missing-16:30-slot anomaly did **not** recur —
every slot since has a session log.

**Audit of the three ✅ flips — all three stand, no demotions.** One auditor
per flip, re-verifying the cited logs, the bounds' provenance, and `git show`
for loosened assertions:
* `MAT-4` step 2 — stands. Identity 0.999846 against a summed 0.26% budget,
  kernel mass 0.040%, surface control 2.2094 within 1.00% of the sphere-sphere
  **lens** ceiling 2.1875 — the plan's flat-interface 2 corrected by
  re-derivation, and the replacement gate is tighter, not looser. The probe
  failure was a code defect (`ufl.real` on a complex-typed comparison), fixed
  without touching any tolerance.
* `POST-3` step 4 — stands. Code-path agreement exactly 0.000e+00 over 5030
  samples against a 1e-12 bound; statistics 9-digit-identical under both phase
  rotations. The control band replaced a never-measured plan prediction with a
  ±2 pp band around the measured 45.40% deficit, failing probe log committed —
  the step-2d-precedent adjudication holds. The `test_lossy_sphere_sar.py`
  diff is comment-only; no bound changed.
* `PORT-1` step 2e — stands. Identity residual 1.6242e-14 against the a-priori
  1e-9; Grover ratio 1.090770 inside the probe-banded (1.042, 1.140); nothing
  widened after a failure. One framing caveat carried forward: the commit
  title's "+7.44 Ω predicted" is a same-solver cross-route consistency number,
  not an independent anchor — the independent physics anchor is Grover at 9%,
  which is what the test actually gates.
* Shared minor caveat, all three: the logs ran at the parent commit with the
  work in-tree (the harness's normal pattern); the next suite-wide run closes
  that provenance gap for free.

**Plan work this review.** The two successors the runs explicitly left "for a
review to scope" got full §7 plans, and the queue's spare got one:
* **`PORT-1` step 2f written** — the projection into the production port path.
  The API question step 2e posed is decided in the entry:
  `project_source: bool = True` on `TimeHarmonicSolver.solve()` backed by a
  `src/` helper — not a wrapper (leaves every caller unprojected, i.e. the
  known-issues-8 state), not a `PortExcitation` object (more than one slot) —
  with known-issues 8 retired only if the re-gated diagonal runs green.
* **`POST-1` step 1 written** — ghost-cell partition invariance of the
  tagged-cell aggregation, the carry-over the 22:30 run sharpened but could
  not measure; probe-first, because a ghost-free tagged set at 12³ would make
  an "exoneration" vacuous.
* **`POST-3` step 5 written** — piecewise μᵣ through the Poynting balance; the
  "magnetic phantom" it waited on is a two-slab μᵣ fixture in the step-2 mold.
  Spare slot deliberately: it is the only queued item touching solver code in
  two places, and its vacuity trap (μᵣ must enter both the bilinear form and
  the flux leg) is stated in the entry.

**Assessment against §10 (step 5).** No gap. Criteria 1–3 route through
`PORT-1` 2f → 3b-i → 3b-ii exactly as the 18:00 review left them — 2f
strengthens the route rather than extending it (a positive, gated diagonal is
what 3b-ii's "print `Z₁₁`, do not gate it" instruction currently works
around). Criterion 4's B1+ chunk stays a named gap, deliberately held for a
review to scope against 3b-ii's findings. No chunk was invented: all three new
step plans were requested by the runs' own hypotheses or already named in a
chunk's "still open" list.

**Items 1–3 are mutually independent; item 4 is the one serial link (depends
on item 1) and says so; item 5 is the spare, also independent.** Item 2
changes a solver default — its §7 entry names the three diagnosis files that
must pin `project_source=False`, which is what keeps items 2 and 4 from
colliding even if both land before the next review.

1. ~~**`PORT-1` step 3b-i — gapped two-torus fixture (mesh only).**~~ —
   **done 2026-08-04 (04:30 run)**: both partition identities and both gap
   boxes at `1.000000000000` against `1e-9`, conductor `0.963633/0.963756` of
   the analytic partial torus, ungapped default unaffected. Gate
   `20260804T093552Z_PORT-1-step3bi-gate.log`. The piece policy is
   gap-wins-over-conductor, not the plan's torus-wins — see the §7 entry before
   writing 3b-ii, which is now unblocked. Original item text follows.
   Independent.
   Execute the §7 step-3b-i plan, written at the 18:00 review. **Anchor:** the
   volume-partition identities `V_mesh/V_box = 1` and `Σ(tagged)/V_mesh = 1`
   at `1e-9`, plus each rectangular gap box meshed/`dx·dy·dz` exact at `1e-9`
   (the `GEO-9` step-2b measured precedent); partial-torus conductor banded
   from measurement against `(angle/2π)·2π²Rr²`. Gap opt-in, **default off**,
   with an ungapped-identity regression in the same run so the seven existing
   test-file users and the 42.15 s CI mesh suite stay byte-unaffected.
   **Negative control:** the unfragmented ancestor's exactly-zero coupling and
   solid-meshed box, on record in the `PORT-1` step-1 logs — cite it.
   **Cost:** smoke/standard, `-n 2` (mandatory), mesh-only; ungapped fixture
   meshes in ~6 s measured — cost-probe the gapped variant, `timeout 180`.
   **Traps:** fragment out-map only, never absolute tags; `occ.getMass`
   before `synchronize`; `global_cell_tag_set()`; pytest `-s`. **Does not
   close:** anything — it is a fixture; `PORT-1` stays 🟡. **Negative
   result:** report the failing surface pair and fragment volume count/masses,
   annotate §7, park on `attempt/*`, stop — no blind gmsh-tolerance iteration.

2. **`PORT-1` step 2f — make the solenoidal projection the production port
   drive.** Independent (two-torus, no gap; reuses step 2e's landed recipe).
   Execute the §7 step-2f plan, written this review — the API decision is
   already made there (`project_source: bool = True` on `solve()`, helper in
   `src/`; do not reopen it in-slot). **Anchor:** re-gate
   `test_port_reaction_impedance.py`'s diagonal — `Im Z₁₁ > 0` a priori,
   Grover ratio inside the measured band `(1.042, 1.140)` (step 2e's 1.090770
   on this identical mesh), complex-power identity residual `< 1e-9`; retire
   known-issues 8 in the same commit **only if green**. **Negative control:**
   the unprojected `−4.108550e+01 Ω`, on record
   (`20260803T183556Z_PORT-1-step2d-gate.log`) — sign flip plus 48.5 Ω; cite,
   do not re-solve. **Cost:** standard, `-n 2`; ~120 s gate (mesh 19.7 s +
   ~18 s curl-curl per port + ~2 s Poisson, all measured in step 2e), probe
   first, then cohabit the four port test files inside the 180 s ceiling.
   **Traps:** the 2b/2d/2e diagnosis tests pin *unprojected* numbers
   (`8.175e-06`, `−41.09 Ω`) — any of them routing through `solve()` must pass
   `project_source=False` explicitly; DG0-indicator load with
   `subdomain_ids=None` when projecting; `create_connectivity` before
   `exterior_facet_indices`; discard `Im ψ` explicitly; a killed run leaves a
   stale FFCx lock. **Does not close:** `PORT-1` (3b and touchstone threading
   remain) or known-issues 3. **Negative result:** report `Im Z₁₁` and
   `4ωW_e/I′²`, hold known-issues 8 open with the measurement appended,
   annotate §7, stop.

3. **`POST-1` step 1 — ghost-cell partition invariance of the tagged-cell
   aggregation.** Independent. Execute the §7 plan, written this review.
   **Anchor:** the production `_tagged_cells` path's count/min/max/mean equal
   to an owned-cells-only allreduced reference (count exact, floats to
   `1e-12`), for both `prefer_interior` paths, at `-n 2` **and** `-n 4`, on
   `POST-3` step 4's piecewise-σ fixture unchanged. **Probe first for the
   ceiling:** print the tagged ghost-cell count per rank; if it is 0 the
   fixture cannot exhibit the defect — say so rather than claim exoneration.
   **Negative control:** a deliberately ghost-inclusive aggregation must
   differ from the owned reference by exactly the tagged ghost count.
   **Cost:** standard; three commands (probe, gate `-n 2`, gate `-n 4`), each
   well under 60 s — step 4's nine tests ran 8.1 s at `-n 2` on this fixture;
   `-n 4` stays inside the 12-core cap. **Traps:** `cell_tags.indices` /
   `.values` are rank-local — reduce before asserting; the owned/ghost split
   is `index_map.size_local`, not a tag property; pytest `-s`; complex build +
   `FEM_EM_REQUIRE_COMPLEX=1`, `tests/environment` first. **Does not close:**
   `POST-1` — the interface-guardrail semantics stay ⚠️; this settles
   rank-safety of the aggregation only. **Negative result:** the failure IS
   the measurement — fix by owned-cell restriction in-slot if it fits, else
   report the per-rank counts, annotate the `POST-1` row and known-issues,
   stop. Never adjust a statistic to match.

4. **`PORT-1` step 3b-ii — gap-voltage `Z₁₂` against the closed form.**
   **Depends on item 1 landing; if 3b-i did not land, skip to item 5 and
   journal rather than attempting this.** Execute the §7 step-3b-ii plan,
   written at the 18:00 review. **Anchor:** `Im Z₁₂ = V₂/I₁` against
   `ωM₁₂ = 1.241755e+00 Ω` (step 1's closed form), band set from the probe
   with step 1's reaction-route 4.6% as the expectation scale; plus
   reciprocity `|Z₁₂ − Z₂₁|/|Z₁₂|` from the second-port solve, banded from
   measurement. **σ is a precomputed constraint:** `σ ≤ 2/(ωμ₀ r_tube²)`
   (skin depth ≥ tube radius; ≈1.0e3 S/m at the fixture's 10 MHz,
   r_wire = 0.005 — recompute if either changes and record). **Do not gate
   `Z₁₁`** — it inherits the gap's series C and the known-issues-8 artifact;
   print it (if item 2 landed first, print it beside the Grover number and
   still do not gate it this slot). **Negative control:** the
   unfragmented-mesh `Z₁₂ = 0` exactly
   (`20260731T213222Z_PORT-1-step1-costprobe.log`) — total separation, on
   record. **Cost:** standard, `-n 2`, mesh ~6–10 s + two ~3 s solves
   (step-1 measurements), well under 60 s; probe first. **Traps:** `V` is a
   volumetric average over the gap tag, never point `eval`; both solves on
   one mesh or reciprocity tests mesh noise; standing complex-build list.
   **Does not close:** `PORT-1` — known-issues 3's red tests and the
   touchstone threading come after. **Negative result:** report `Z₁₂`,
   `Z₂₁`, `V₂/I₁` and the σ/δ used, annotate §7 and known-issues 3, stop.

5. **`POST-3` step 5 — piecewise μᵣ through the Poynting balance (spare).**
   Independent. Execute the §7 step-5 plan, written this review. **Anchor:**
   the parameter-free real-power identity on a two-slab μᵣ = 1|2 solve —
   imbalance falls under refinement at ~O(h) (steps 1–2 measured
   0.987/0.9915) with fine-mesh imbalance < 5% (§10's bar, unmoved; pick the
   fine level from a refinement probe as step 2 did), plus the no-solve
   scalar-path pin: uniform DG0 μᵣ = 1 reproduces the scalar-μᵣ numbers to
   `rtol = 1e-12`. **Negative control, ceiling measured first:** μᵣ-blind
   flux leg scored against the honest solve; band from the probe — steps
   1–2's controls saturated near 1/imbalance, so compute the ceiling before
   asserting a factor. **Cost:** standard, `-n 2`, ~90 s budget (step 2's
   two-level gate measured 64.5 s); probe first. **Traps:** μᵣ enters the
   bilinear form (`time_harmonic.py:400`) **and** the flux leg
   (`power_balance.py:111`) — fixing only one is the vacuous version;
   `MaterialProperties.mu_r` validation currently rejects non-scalars —
   extend it with the field, not around it; ½ peak-phasor convention;
   complex build + `FEM_EM_REQUIRE_COMPLEX=1`. **Does not close:** `POST-3` —
   the reciprocity leg waits on 3b-ii's two-source fixture. **Negative
   result:** report imbalance and rate at both levels, annotate §7, stop — an
   identity failing on piecewise μᵣ after passing on piecewise σ is
   information about the μᵣ discretisation, not a tolerance problem.

If the queue drains: **stop and journal.** Do **not** improvise gap-voltage
ports on the birdcage itself or a B1+ chunk — both are deliberately held for
a review to scope against 3b-ii's findings (including whether `GEO-4`'s
graded sizing is a birdcage prerequisite, per the 15:00 run's 0.7091
measurement).

Every frequency-domain command needs `source /usr/local/bin/dolfinx-complex-mode`
**and** `FEM_EM_REQUIRE_COMPLEX=1`, with `tests/environment` first in the pytest
path list, so an environment regression fails before the formulation tests get
blamed.

## 10. Success criteria

### MVP (end of Phase 2)
- [x] Time-harmonic solver reproduces the analytic lossy plane-wave solution to < 5% *(3.61% in L2; decay constant 0.019%, `TH-6`)*
- [x] Helmholtz coil magnetostatic result matches analytic to < 5% *(0.04%)*
- [x] Phantom σ and εᵣ measurably change the solved field *(σ: interior decay
  constants each match their own closed form and their ratio is 10.3232 vs the
  closed-form 10.3116, `MAT-2`; εᵣ: at εᵣ = 78 the measured β = 27.03 rad/m
  matches the εᵣ-dependent closed form 27.02 to 0.059% where vacuum would give
  2.68, `TH-6`. The loaded-**coil** claim landed 2026-07-31: the FEM ΔR of a
  loop over a conductive half-space matches Dodd–Deeds to 1.58%, `MAT-6` step
  2b — in the eddy-current regime, not yet at saline/Larmor.)*

### Target (end of Phase 4)
- [ ] Loaded birdcage + phantom simulation runs end to end *(the mesh half is
  done: both fixtures generate and are identity-gated in CI as of 2026-08-03,
  `GEO-9` steps 1 + 2b. What remains is excitation — `PORT-1` step 3b-i/3b-ii
  on the two-torus validation pair, then ports on the birdcage itself.)*
- [ ] S-parameters derived from the solved field, not a coupling heuristic
  *(partial: the **conversion** is now packaged — `PORT-1` step 3a, 2026-08-03,
  `sparameters_from_impedance()` in `ports/sparameters.py`, gated bit-identical
  to the test path on a solved field — but the only impedance matrix feeding it
  is the two-loop air fixture's, and `run_n_port_sparameter_sweep` still calls
  the heuristic. `PORT-1` step 3b puts it on a coil.)*
- [ ] S-matrix satisfies reciprocity and passivity within stated tolerance
  *(demonstrated on that same fixture, and as of `PORT-1` step 3a, 2026-08-03,
  through **`PORT-5`'s own metrics** rather than the test's arithmetic:
  `passivity_max_sigma = 1.000000000000` and unit column power sums to `1e-9`,
  `reciprocity_max_abs_delta = 3.4981e-13`. Left open because the matrix is
  still a two-loop air fixture's and `PORT-5`'s sweep-level path is untouched;
  what step 3a removed was the "placeholder matrices only" objection.)*
- [ ] B1+ field matches literature/measured data qualitatively *(routes through
  the coil+phantom fixture, which `GEO-9` step 1 gated on 2026-08-03; nothing
  has yet computed B1+ on it.)*

### Stretch (Phase 6)
- [ ] Multi-channel coil optimization
- [ ] Validation results published
- [ ] Community adoption
